# Develop the instruction fetch-decode-execute cycle.

To develop the instruction fetch-decode-execute cycle for a basic processor, we can break down the process into key tasks:

𝟏. 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐅𝐞𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐌𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐬𝐦
- Instruction Register (IR): Holds the instruction fetched from memory.
- Program Counter (PC): Holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched.
- Memory: Stores the instructions and data.
The fetching process typically involves:
- Step 1: The PC holds the address of the next instruction.
- Step 2: The instruction at that address is fetched from memory.
- Step 3: The PC is updated to point to the next instruction.
- Step 4: The fetched instruction is loaded into the IR.

𝟐. 𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬
- The fetched instruction in the IR needs to be decoded into its components, such as:
- Opcode: Determines the operation to be performed.
- Operand(s): Specifies the data or registers involved in the operation.
The decoding process typically involves:
- Step 1: Identifying the opcode (for example, ADD, SUB, etc.).
- Step 2: Extracting operands (register numbers, immediate values, etc.).
- Step 3: Determining which registers and/or memory locations need to be used.

𝟑.𝐄𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬
- The actual execution of the instruction involves using the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and the registers.
- ALU: Performs arithmetic or logical operations based on the instruction.
- Registers: Store operands and results during the execution.
The execution process involves:

- Step 1: The ALU performs the operation specified by the opcode.
- Step 2: The result is stored in the destination register or memory.
- Step 3: Update the program counter if needed (for control flow operations like jumps).
