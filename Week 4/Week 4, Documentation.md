# Develop the instruction fetch-decode-execute cycle.

To develop the instruction fetch-decode-execute cycle for a basic processor, we can break down the process into key tasks:

𝟏. 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐅𝐞𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐌𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐬𝐦
- 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫 (𝐈𝐑): Holds the instruction fetched from memory.
- 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 (𝐏𝐂): Holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched.
- 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲: Stores the instructions and data.
The fetching process typically involves:
- 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟏: The PC holds the address of the next instruction.
- 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟐: The instruction at that address is fetched from memory.
- 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟑: The PC is updated to point to the next instruction.
- 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟒: The fetched instruction is loaded into the IR.

𝟐. 𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬
- The fetched instruction in the IR needs to be decoded into its components, such as:
- 𝐎𝐩𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞: Determines the operation to be performed.
- 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐝(𝐬): Specifies the data or registers involved in the operation.
The decoding process typically involves:
- 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟏: Identifying the opcode (for example, ADD, SUB, etc.).
- 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟐: Extracting operands (register numbers, immediate values, etc.).
- 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟑: Determining which registers and/or memory locations need to be used.

𝟑.𝐄𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬
- The actual execution of the instruction involves using the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and the registers.
- 𝐀𝐋𝐔: Performs arithmetic or logical operations based on the instruction.
- 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬: Store operands and results during the execution.
The execution process involves:

- 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟏: The ALU performs the operation specified by the opcode.
- 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟐: The result is stored in the destination register or memory.
- 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟑: Update the program counter if needed (for control flow operations like jumps).
