#  Define Basic Instructions
The ISA will include the following basic instructions:

1. 𝐀𝐃𝐃 (𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧): Adds two registers and stores the result in a destination register.
2. 𝐒𝐔𝐁 (𝐒𝐮𝐛𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧): Subtracts one register from another and stores the result.
3. 𝐋𝐎𝐀𝐃 (𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝): Loads a value from memory into a register.
4. 𝐒𝐓𝐎𝐑𝐄 (𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞): Stores the value from a register into memory.
5. 𝐌𝐎𝐕 (𝐌𝐨𝐯𝐞): Moves data from one register to another.
6. 𝐇𝐀𝐋𝐓 (𝐇𝐚𝐥𝐭): Stops execution.


These instructions will be represented by opcode values, and each instruction will have operands that specify the registers or memory locations involved.
