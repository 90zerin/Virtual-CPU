# Implement memory management for the virtual CPU.

The 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 project for a virtual CPU involves simulating and managing how a CPU interacts with memory. Here's a brief breakdown:

1.  𝐒𝐢𝐦𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐞: Create a virtual memory space that mimics physical memory. This memory space is typically organized as an array or a set of blocks, where data can be stored and retrieved.

2. 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐝/𝐖𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: Implement operations to read from and write to memory. These operations should access memory locations based on provided addresses and handle any necessary data formatting or alignment.

3. 𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐌𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲  𝐒𝐞𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Implement a method to translate logical addresses (from the CPU’s perspective) into physical memory addresses. This may involve dividing memory into segments (e.g., code, data, stack) and using a technique like paging or segmentation to manage different regions of memory effectively.

In essence, the project aims to simulate how a CPU interacts with memory, ensuring efficient access, data integrity, and managing address translation to handle different memory segments.
