𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞

The virtual CPU emulator will be implemented in C++ due to its:

1. 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: C++ allows to manage memory directly, which is essential when simulating the memory architecture of a CPU.

2. 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞: C++ is compiled to machine code, which means it runs faster than interpreted languages. This is crucial for emulating CPU instructions efficiently.

3. 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭-𝐎𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠: You can use classes to represent different components of the CPU, such as the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), registers, and instruction sets. This makes the code more organized and modular.

# Tools

1. 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐫: Use a C++ compiler like GCC or Clang.

2. 𝐈𝐃𝐄: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is recommended for development, providing robust support for C++ through extensions, debugging tools, and Git integration.

3. 𝐕𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥: Git is essential for managing the code changes and collaborating with others.

4. 𝐃𝐞𝐛𝐮𝐠𝐠𝐞𝐫: GDB (GNU Debugger) can help you troubleshoot and step through your code to find issues.

5. 𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Project documentation will be maintained in Markdown format and hosted on GitHub, enabling collaboration and easy version control.
