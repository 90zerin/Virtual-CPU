# Features of the Virtual CPU

When designing a virtual CPU emulator, there are several key features you might want to consider implementing:


1. 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐞𝐭 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 (𝐈𝐒𝐀): Define the set of instructions that the virtual CPU will support. This includes arithmetic operations, control flow instructions, and memory access instructions.

2. 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬: Implement a set of registers for the CPU to use for temporary data storage. Common registers include general-purpose registers, a program counter, and a stack pointer.

3. 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: Create a way to manage memory, including allocating space for variables and handling memory addresses for instructions and data.

4.  𝐄𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐂𝐲𝐜𝐥𝐞: Develop the fetch-decode-execute cycle, which is the process the CPU uses to execute instructions. The CPU fetches an instruction from memory, decodes it to understand what action to take, and then executes that action.

5. 𝐈𝐧𝐩𝐮𝐭/𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐩𝐮𝐭 (𝐈/𝐎) 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠: Implement mechanisms for the virtual CPU to interact with input and output devices, such as reading from a keyboard or displaying output on a screen.

6. 𝐄𝐫𝐫𝐨𝐫 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠: Incorporate error handling to manage invalid instructions or memory access violations gracefully.

7. 𝐃𝐞𝐛𝐮𝐠𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬: Provide tools to help debug the emulator, such as step execution, breakpoints, and memory inspection.

8. 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐬: Optionally, include features to measure the performance of the CPU, such as instruction throughput and execution time.

These features will help you create a robust virtual CPU emulator.
