# To implement general-purpose registers
 In the context of a basic CPU simulation, we need to represent a set of registers that can store values and perform operations. General-purpose registers (GPRs) are used by a CPU to hold intermediate results during computations.

 Let's break down the task of implementing general-purpose registers in a C++ CPU simulation.

 1. 𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬: We can represent registers as an array of integers. For simplicity, we'll assume the CPU has 8 general-purpose registers.

 2. 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: We'll implement functions to:
 - 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐚 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫: Get the value from a specific register.

- 𝐖𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐚 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫: Store a value into a specific register.

- 𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬: Set initial values for the registers (e.g., 0 or any predefined values).

3. 𝐒𝐢𝐦𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐔𝐬𝐚𝐠𝐞: The general-purpose registers can interact with the ALU or any other CPU components to perform operations.
